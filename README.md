# CSS Administration System

## Overview

The CSS Administration System is a platform designed to manage the various roles and responsibilities within the CSS Department. It is organized into sections corresponding to different levels of access, ensuring proper permissions are granted to each role. The system allows the President, or the Admin (acting as a proxy when the President is unavailable), to manage these permissions effectively.

## Sections

The system is divided into the following sections:

- **Accounts and Permissions Management**
- **Academics and Resources**
- **Events and News**
- **Timeline and Executive Position History (Achievements)**
- **Advertisements**
- **And More**

### Permissions Management

Each section of the system has specific permissions that are set up by the President or the current members in office. Permissions define what each administrator role is allowed to do in the system, such as who can create news, approve resources, or write event details.

For example:

- The President may decide that only the Secretary can write news, and it must be approved by the PRO before it goes live.
- These permissions can be set up without requiring coding, and detailed instructions will be provided in the documentation.

## Accounts and Permissions Management

Every CSS Executive or appointee is provided with an Administrator account by the elected President. During account creation, permissions are set according to the user's role. The account details, such as email, phone number, and a custom password, are provided, and the user can change their password later.

### **Account Activation:**

- Once the account is created, an email is sent with login credentials, allowing the user to log in, change their password, and start working right away.

### **Account Misuse:**

- If an account or position is misused, the President can deactivate the account (not delete it). The account can be reactivated after careful consideration.

## Academics and Resources

This section allows the President or the executive in charge of academics to create courses and add resources that students need. Resources such as YouTube videos, articles, and files (e.g., slides, PDFs) can be added to these courses after the President's approval.

- Once approved, resources will be made available on the front-end for students to browse and use.
- Files will remain in the system until manually deleted, and they may be available for years unless removed.

### **Note:**

- The President or the Academic Board must approve resources before they are displayed, as only trusted content is shared with students.

## Events and News

The Events and Programs section grants permissions to those in charge to write about upcoming events in the department, along with pictures and videos. This allows the department to keep students informed about upcoming activities.

---

## Timeline and Executive Position History (Achievements)

The Timeline is a historical record of events and programs within the department. After each event, pictures and videos are uploaded to the platform with student names tagged. If approved by the President, these are displayed publicly.

The goal of this feature is to preserve memories of department activities. Even years later, students can search for their names and view the events they participated in, along with related photos.

- Pictures can be removed from the timeline through a special request from the user, along with an explanation. If approved, the pictures will be removed.

## News

Similar to events, this section is where news related to the department is written on the admin dashboard. The news is published dynamically, so it doesn't need to be hardcoded each time. News updates are automatically displayed for students to read.

---

## Advertisements

On the business side, the system allows ads to be displayed in order to generate sponsorship for the department. These ads are controlled by the department and can appear on the news site, event announcements, and other sections once approved.

---

## History

The system logs all activity within the admin dashboard for feedback purposes, as well as tracking the most recent logins. Accounts are arranged by the latest login, with the most recent user appearing at the top.

---

## The Plan

The frontend of the system will be open-source, allowing students to contribute. The backend will be maintained by core students for academic purposes, providing hands-on experience and the opportunity to work on a live project. This initiative aims to boost students' confidence in tackling real-world systems.
