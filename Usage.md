The CSS Administration System

The system is divided into sections corresponding to the different levels of roles and positions available in the CSS Department. Permissions for each level should be carefully managed by the President or the Admin, who acts as a proxy for the President if the President is too busy to manage the system. This is done with the President's permission.

Sections: The sections include:

    Accounts and Permissions Management
    Academics and Resources
    Events and News
    Timeline and Executive Position History (Achievements)
    Advertisements
    And more

Note: Each of the sections named above has its permissions set up, which will be handled by the current President and the current members in office. By "permissions," I mean what each administration position, or whoever is in the position, is allowed to do on the admin system. For example, the President may decide that news should only be written by the Secretary and approved by the PRO before it goes live or appears on the front-end side of the page. He can do this by setting up the necessary permissions without any coding, which will be explained later in the documentation.

PLEASE CALL FOR ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS, AS SOME FEATURES GO INTO MUCH MORE DETAIL PRACTICALLY.

Accounts: Every CSS Executive or appointee is given an Administrator account by the elected President, with each permission role specifying what they can do on the system, what they are allowed to see, and what they cannot see. These permissions are set up during account creation, along with their email, phone number, and a custom password that they can change later. When the account is created, an email is sent to the email address provided, allowing them to log in, change their custom password, and begin working right away.

Note: Misuse of the account or position will prompt the President to deactivate the account (not delete it), which can later be reactivated after careful consideration.

Academics and Resources: The system includes an academic section. In this section, the executive in charge of academics or the President can create courses that they believe students need resources for. After the courses are created, resource links such as YouTube videos, articles, and files (e.g., slides, PDFs) can be added to the courses after approval by the President. These resources will then be displayed on the front-end for students to search through and use. These files will remain until they are deleted from the database. Files, like past resources, will remain on the platform for years unless deleted.

Note: The President or the Academic Board's approval is needed before the resource is displayed, as we wouldn't want any shady links shown to students.

Events: The Events and Programs section grants permissions to those in charge to write about upcoming events in the department, along with pictures and videos.

Timeline: The Timeline is a history of the department. After every event or program, pictures and videos are posted on the platform, with student names tagged. If approved by the President, these are displayed to the public and community. The goal of this feature is to preserve memories for the department, so that even years later, a student can search their name and see the event they attended and the pictures taken. Pictures can be removed from the timeline by special request from the user, along with a letter explaining the reason. If approved, they will be taken down.

News: Similar to events, this section of the system is where news is written on the admin dashboard. Published news doesn't need to be hardcoded, and any news written by the department will be displayed here for students to read.

Advertisements: On the business side, ads can be run to generate money to sponsor the department if needed. These ads are controlled by the department and displayed on news sites, event announcements, etc., once approved.

History: The system records any activity that happens on the admin dashboard for feedback purposes, as well as the last person who logged in. Accounts are arranged by the most recent logins, with the latest login appearing at the top.

The Plan: The frontend of the system will be open-source for students to contribute to. The backend system will be maintained by core students for academic purposes (hands-on practical experience to work on a live project, giving students the confidence to tackle real-world systems).
